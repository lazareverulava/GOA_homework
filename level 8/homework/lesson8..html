<p><i>The Nissan Skyline GT-R was the high performance variant of the R34 Skyline that debuted in 1999.
The R34 GT-R is one of the most well known and sought after versions of the famed GT-R. Commonly
referred to as "Godzilla," these all wheel drive performance coupes were powered by Nissan's 
revered RB26DETT engine. This highly tunable engine was offered with power between 327hp and 
493hp, depending on the variant. Alongside the standard Base Model, notable variants included 
the V-Spec I, V-Spec II, NÃ¼r, and NISMO Z-Tune. Although the majority of R34 GT-Rs were sold in 
the Japanese market, a little over 100 examples were exported to markets like the UK, Hong Kong,
Singapore, and New Zealand. In total, 11,578 examples of the R34 GT-R were built before the end 
of production in August of 2002.
